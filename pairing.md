# Pairing


## Benefits

* Sharing knowledge among team members (the "[bus factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor)")
* Writing better software (two pairs of eyes, less procastination, etc.)
* It does not double costs because coding is more than typing, it's design analysis, deep thinking, and problem solving
* Improves communications skills
* Tangencial learning from each other (tools, editor shortcuts, etc.)


## Pair programming

* SC companies do it 100% of job time
* Two styles:
    - Driver and navigator with rotations,
    - Ping-pong (one writes the test, the other writes the code to make it pass, switch and repeat)
* Configuration:
    - Same device, two keyboards (means all devices should use same OS and environment configuration) or
    - Change device and `git pull` (more freedom, each crafter gets commits under their name)
* 101 of pairing: count to 10 before correcting typos
* Speak in a low voice to avoid disturbing other people in the room
* Need space and comfortable chairs
* Take breaks
* No phone calls or messages until the break (that's what it is for!)
* Don't hog the keyboard. Don't dominate. You are PAIRING.


## Mob programming

* One driver and several navigators
* Works better when starting a project from scratch. Once it has structure and direction the team can switch to pairing.
* Rotations after 5-8 minutes. Use a tool to alarm you when time is down. 
* Take a break after 4-5 rotations
* Again there are two configurations: same device or different devices with `git pull`
* No meetings to discuss design decissions because everybody is in the same room.
* Avoid monopolizing the discussion, be short and to the point, everybody needs to contribute.
* From the mob programming book "_show Kindness, Consideration, and Respect_".
* Usually people do a retrospective afterwards on what went right and what went wrong
